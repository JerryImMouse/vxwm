.SH NAME
vxwm \- versatile X window manager (dwm fork)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vxwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
vxwm is a versatile dynamic window manager for X, forked from dwm.  
It adds quality-of-life features such as 8-sided resize, cursor warping, enhanced floating toggle, gaps, fullscreen support and more — all of which can be enabled or disabled at compile time via simple defines in modules.h (similar in spirit to dwm-flexipatch).  

It manages windows in three layouts: tiled, monocle and floating. Layouts can be switched dynamically to optimize for the current task or application.

In tiled layout, windows are arranged in a master area (left, one window by default) and a stacking area (right). The number of master windows and master area size are adjustable. Monocle maximizes all windows to screen size. Floating allows free moving and resizing. Dialogs and certain window types are always managed as floating.

Windows are organized by tags. Each window can have one or multiple tags; viewing a tag (or set of tags) shows all windows with matching tags.

The status bar (per screen) displays tags, current layout symbol, focused window title, and root window name text (set via xsetroot(1)). Selected tags use different colors; occupied tags and focused window tags are indicated with squares.

A small border around windows shows focus state.

.SH CUSTOMIZATION
vxwm is configured by editing
.B config.h
(keys, colors, rules, bar, etc.) and
.B modules.h
(enabling/disabling patches and features), then recompiling.  
This approach keeps vxwm fast, minimal and secure.
.SH SEE ALSO

.BR dmenu (1),
.BR st (1),
.BR xsetroot (1)
.SH ISSUES
Java applications using XToolkit/XAWT may show only grey windows due to ICCCM non-compliance assumptions in older JDK versions.  

Workarounds:
- set
.B AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit
- run
.B wmname LG3D
or
.B xprop -root -f _NET_WM_NAME 32a -set _NET_WM_NAME LG3D
- for OpenJDK:
.B _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1
